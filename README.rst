Variantstore
============
The **Variantstore** is a Java/Groovy-based service application implemented using the `Micronaut framework <https://micronaut.io>`_ and enables storage and access to information on genomic variants and metadata from a connected database *via* a RESTful API. 


Features
--------
- Import variants (VCF files, annotated using `SnpEff <http://snpeff.sourceforge.net>`_ or `VEP <https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html>`_)
- Import metadata in JSON together with variants (see `Usage <https://oncostore-proto-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ for details)
- Import gene information (Ensembl, GFF3 files)
- Query information on variants, genes, and cases via (secured) REST endpoints
- Ask Beacon endpoint if a specific variant exists in the store
- Export variants in Variant Call Format (VCF) and `FHIR <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/>`_


Documentation
-------------
Please visit the `Documentation <https://oncostore-proto-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for detailed installation, run and configuration instructions.

Detailed documentation of the RESTful API is additionally available on `SwaggerHub <https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/christopher-mohr/variantstore/0.6>`_.


Database
--------
In the current version, the **Variantstore** service can be used with a MariaDB database. If you want to use a different DBMS,
make sure to specify the database model, set up the datasource in the ``application.yml``, and provide an implementation for the ``VariantstoreStorage`` interface.

We are currently working on the support of `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_.
